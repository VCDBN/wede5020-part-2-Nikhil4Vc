We will be on the look out for people who enjoy teaching and educating other on how to use these technological devices. This is one of our projects that will help close the gap of the digital divide by educating others and teaching the basics of the internet. We encourage the youth to volunteer and lead these projects. When people know how to use various devices it opens up a whole new world for them. People would become more social and be able to gain access to more infomation and job opportunities.</p>

Cause always remember that the blurred image around your phone is called life.</p>
